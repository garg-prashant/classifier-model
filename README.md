# classifier-model

A machine learning classifier model for text classification tasks.

## Overview

This project implements a text classifier that can categorize text documents into predefined classes. The model uses natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify text data.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Multiple classification algorithms support
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction capabilities for new text data
- Performance metrics and visualization

## Setup python3 virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

python train_model.py
