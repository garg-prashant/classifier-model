# Machine Learning Pipeline

A complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification using synthetic data.

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that generates synthetic datasets, trains a Random Forest classifier, and evaluates model performance. The pipeline includes data generation, CSV I/O operations, model training with scikit-learn, model persistence, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generation with configurable sample size
- CSV data persistence and loading capabilities
- Random Forest classifier implementation
- Train/test data splitting
- Model serialization using pickle
- Performance evaluation with accuracy scores and classification reports
- Complete pipeline automation from data generation to model evaluation

## Setup python3 virtual environment
